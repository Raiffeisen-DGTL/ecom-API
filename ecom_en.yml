    # Payment acceptance protocol

    To receive e-commerce, follow the [link.](https://www.raiffeisen.ru/corporate/management/commerce/)

    For all questions regarding operations with API, please contact Raiffeisenbank Support Service:
    - email: <a href="mailto:ecom@raiffeisen.ru">ecom@raiffeisen.ru</a>

    ### Preparatory Actions
    In order to accept payments, you need to:
    * submit an application for connection
    * conclude an agreement with Raiffeisenbank
    * choose an integration method and implement it
    * successfully conduct test payments.

    ### Payment page integration methods
    In order to integrate the payment page, you can use:
    * a ready-made library that allows you to open a pop-up for entering payment data and transferring complex data structures.
    * redirection of the client to the payment page of Raiffeisenbank

    ## Support 54-ФЗ

    We don't restrict your choice of fiscal solutions, but we recommend using a solution from our partners:
    * To integrate with the operator's fiscal data [АТОЛ.](https://online.atol.ru/lk/Account/Register?partnerUid=18583cd5-dae2-4fb1-a98b-f4b80d891eb0)
    * Use the [Paykeeper](https://raiffeisen-processing.ru) solutions.

    # Payment process
    Demonstration:
    https://e-commerce.raiffeisen.ru/pay/demo.html

    The user performs the following actions during the payment process:
    * Selects goods/services into the shopping cart and clicks "Pay".
    * The store opens up the payment form.
    * The customer enters the relevant details on the payment form and confirms the payment.

    The payment execution scheme is presented below:

    # API description
    Interaction is conducted with the HTTP protocol using the GET/POST methods (the description of each request clearly indicates the required method and address).

    POST requests use JSON arguments, GET requests work with query strings.

    API always returns a response in JSON format, regardless of the type of request.

    The response of any method contains a message code. If a logical error occurs during the processing of any request, API will return an additional description of the error (message).


    ##  Authorization

    In order to authorize requests, you will need:
    * publicId - identifier that is used to open a payment form and is not confidential
    * secretKey - a secret key that is used for interservice communication.

    IMPORTANT: The secret key must be stored in a secure place, it cannot be published on third-party resources or transferred to third parties.

    You can view your public identifier and generate keys in your [personal account](https://rbo.raiffeisen.ru) in the "Accept payments" tab

    Interservice requests are authorized using API secret key (SECRET_KEY). The authorization parameter is specified in the Authorization header, the value of which is formed as "Bearer SECRET_KEY".

    In order to generate a secret key, please contact: ecom@raiffeisen.ru

    ## Errors
    The response of any method contains a message code. If a logical error occurs during the processing of any request, API will return an additional description of the error (message).

    HTTP-code | code | message | Comments
    --------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------
    200 | SUCCESS | Request processed successfully | Successful processing of the request without logical and system failures
    200 | ERROR.<Error_code> | Text message on error | Logical error during processing of the request
    500 | ERROR.INTERNAL | Error | System error during processing of the request

    # Testing
    ## E-commerce
    For a full payment testing cycle, you must specify an amount of more than 10 rubles.
    Cards:
    * 2200300100000023 12/24 880 - No 3DS
    * 4000001000000018 12/24 880  PIN for success payment : 1234, 1111  - 3DS

    ## SBP
    For a full payment testing cycle, Raiffeisenbank provides the opportunity to use a demo application for scanning QRC on behalf of the buyer at:
    https://rfuture.site

    * Login - demo
    * Password - demo

    The specified address can be opened in the browser of any device with a camera. No additional software / plugins need to be installed. Then click on the SBP icon (if necessary, allow the browser access to the camera) and bring the QR code image to it.
    If the camera doesn't open, check the url, it has to have https.

      Using the library allows you to open the form in a pop-up window, which provides a seamless script for the client.
      It is also possible to customize the interface of the payment form and transfer additional fields.

      Using the JS library is described in the repository https://github.com/Raiffeisen-DGTL/ecom-sdk-javascript

      Below is an example of a request for payment:

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Payment" />

  - name: payform
    x-displayName: 'Payment form'
    description: |
      Easy way to integrate. The client must be redirected to the payment form, passing the order parameters. Customization of the form interface or transfer of additional fields is not available in this integration option.

      To implement interaction with a partner, Raiffeisenbank provides an API:
      * for opening a payment form using HTTP requests;
      * for receiving payment status.

  - name: Callback
    x-displayName: 'Payment notification'
    description: |
      In order to inform the Merchant site about payments made, HTTP notifications to the address specified in its settings can be used.

      The prod url can be specified in the [personal account] (https://rbo.raiffeisen.ru) in the "Accept payments" tab.

      For partners, a notification is presented as an incoming POST request that uses the JSON structure.

      A notification is considered accepted if the recipient responded to the request with HTTP 200.

      Responses with any other HTTP codes will be considered invalid. Repeated attempts to send will be conducted during the day with increasing intervals.

      In order to verify the authenticity of the notification, a signature is added to the data in the x-api-signature-sha256 header, obtained on the basis of the shared secret key and control string (amount|publickId|order|paymentStatus|transactionDate) by way of HMAC-SHA-256.
